1) Test the data in order to see if there is any differences in the production of P and IAA among the different strains. 
	1.1 One-way anova for each of the variables (P and IAA)
		-Function to use: aov(#Production(P or IAA)#, #Strain#, data = #our data source#)
		
		-Use a posthoc test to check the different groups (a, b, c...)
			Use agricolae::HSD.test() or TukeyHSD() 

	1.2 Normality test
		Function to use: shapiro.test() <- has to be done to the Residuals, not the raw data
	
	1.3 Look if there is interaction between the two variables
		Mediation or Moderation -> we need profs guide with this 

2) Plot the results: NOT IN A BARPLOT (https://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/plots_to_avoid.html)
	2.1 Try Boxplot

	2.2 Try Violinplot

	2.3 Possibility to group the strais by philogentic groups and show it in the plot (colors, maybe)
		Check the article and study the possibility of adding a column with the philogenetic group of each strain

3) Test the performance of the strains in the greenhouse experiments

	3.1 Check for significative differences -> anova and posthoc test (for the groups)
		3.1.1 In the article they use Duncan as posthoc: investigate why and if its the most apropiate analysis. COmpare with Tukey.

4) Plot the results better than in the article
   
5) New analysis:
	5.1 Try principal components or similar multivariate analyses to group the performance variables in less variables.
 		Tutorial recommended: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/118-principal-component-analysis-in-r-prcomp-vs-princomp/
 	
	5.2 Professor suggested that we can learn how to use discriminant analysis to predict the species from the performance data.

*6) If you have time left, it might be also interesting to play with the table 1 genetic sequences from genbank. Two possible approaches are genoplotR and Bioconductor:

7) PREPARE THE RMARKDOWN WITH OUR RESULTS
